1. THE BEGlNNlNGS OF ROME’.

THE legends of the founding of Rome and nithe reigns of the seven
kings, although believed in by the Romans themselves, and generally ac-
cepted in modern times until the publication of the frrst volume of Niebuhr's
Histmy of Rome, in 1811, cannot be accepted as history. They are largely
aetiological‚ that is, many of the stories have been invented to explain
customs and institutions which were'already in existence at the beginning
of the historical period, and many of them may be naced to Greek
sources. Ήιε dates were traditional with the Romans themselves, and
are not to be relied on. According to Lewis (On tlte &edibility os
Early Roman Hirtam), a trustworthy history of Rome does not begin until
the war with Pyrrhus. ln this statement he undoubtedly goes too far; but
the history of the period before the destruction oi the city by the Gauls in
39⁰ B.c., while it narrates some historical facts, cannot be accepted as
genuine in the form in which it has come down to us.

For an excellent discussion of the ,historioal value of these legends‚ see
lhne’s Early Rome.
