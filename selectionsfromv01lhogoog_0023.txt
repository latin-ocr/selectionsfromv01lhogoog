xii Hints on Metltod

they understand the meaning of what they have read. They
should acquire the habit of doing this without translating, even
in tlte mind, Reading the Latin, therefore, should not be an
occasional exercise, but a regular and important part of each
and every recitation, and of the pupil's preparation for recitation.
ln this connection, as well as an important aid in writing Latin,
the practice of committing to memory selected passages oi Latin,
and reciting them with correctness and expression, is a most
helpiul exercise which is too often wholly neglected.

The V1n1 Rounn is particularly rich in anecdotos which may
be used in this way. ’

2. Translation. Translation into English should be insisted

possible. The pupil should learn to grasp the meaning of a

Latin sentence in the orzgz'nal, following the order os tlte Latin
words. He should also learn to express that meaning in adzo-
⁸matic English. A literal translation should never be allowed,
unless it happen to be also idiomatic. The charge is often
seriously made that the study ol Latin ruins one’s English style,
and a real danger undoubtedly exists. ll, however, the pupil be
trained from the outset to thz'rzk r'n Latin, bad English need
never be used to explain the meaning of difficult sentences.

The ear should be trained as well as the eye. Thereiore the
pupil should occasionally be called on to translate, without the
text before him, passages read to him by his teacher. Olten
pupils who have acquired some facility in translating are unable
to comprehend simple sentences when read to them, or even to
write them in Latin from dictation.

Pupils should acquire the ability to understand and trans-
late au'y Latin in which the words and the constructions are
familiar to them3 that is to say, to translate at sight. To this
end they should master all new constructionS, and should learn
