Selected orations and Letters' of Q)

With Introduction, Notes, and Vocabulary by Professor Francis ¹W.
Kansnv. ramo, half bether, 518 peges. Illustrated. Price‚ 5125.

HE Orations given in this edition are the four against Cati·
line, those for the Manilian Law, Archias, Marcellus, and
the fourth oration against Antony. These are edited with a
view to showing their value as examples of oratory, rather than
as offering mere material for grammatical drill. The student's
attention is directed to the occasion and circumstances of their
delivery, as well as to the motive and method of presenting the
matter contained in them. Modes of legal procedure, the Con-
stitution and form of government in Cicero's time, and the whole
environment of the orator, are brought into clear view, and made
'a reality to the student. ,
The letters are selected with reference to the light they shed
ou Cicero as a man rather than as a politician. T hey afford
pleasant glimpses of his private life, and help to make real the
pupil's conception of the times in which he lived. As material
for short exercises for sight translation or rapid reading they
will be found of special value.
A Table of ldioms and Phrases presents in form convenient
for use, constructions that deserve special attention.

meoln Owen, Principal of tlte Rice Τ mining-deol, Boston: Kelsey’s
Cicero isa model in the art of text-book making. lt cannot fail to be a
success for editor, publisher, and user. l count the teachers and the pupils
of the present generation fortunate in having such admirable “ instruments Ἰ
of education ’' as Professor Kelsey is preparing for us.

Professor J. W. Stearns, University of Wisconsin: Kelsey’s Cicero com-

mends itself more than any words of mine can commend it. lt is a teach· =

er’s book, up to modern times, both in text and annotations, and admirably
printed.

Miss Ellen F. show, Higlr school, Keene, N.H.: 1 have now used it in my
classes for fwe weeks in connection with . . . in the hands of apart of
the class. Kelsey has the preference every time. 1t gives a body to the
ideas, and tells the scholars things that they want to know in a way suited
to them. l have been waiting long enough to test it, and l like it better
every week. =
