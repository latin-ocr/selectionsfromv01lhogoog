S in the editions of Caesar and Cicero by the same editor,

no pains have been spared to make the book pleasing to

the eye and useful to the student. The selections, witha few

exceptions‚ are short and complete in themselves. A consider-
able number of them will be found suitable for sight-reading.

The Introduction contains a sketch of the life and works of

Ovirl, with a short essay on Ovid as a poet, together with an

outline of Greek and Roman Mythology.
“ The Notes are elementary, but at the same time they aim to
’ suggest a poetic interpretation of the author.

william C. collar, Headmaster‚ Roxbury Latin Sciool, Mass: l am glad to
see an edition containing so good and so varied a collection from Ovid's
writings. The book seems to me to be a very conscientious pieoe of work,
and l am particularly pleased with the frequent and happy quotations, in
the notes, of passages from English poets.

Walter A. Edwards, Principal,¹ Higlr Sclrool, Rocksord, Ill.: l am delighted
with it. The editor has made an excellent school-book, without thrusting
into the background the literary charm of the text he is annotating. The

’ abundant quotations from the English poets must materially help toward
a right appreciation and enjoyment of Ovid’s poetry.

L.c.11uil,tawrenceville School, N J. .· Professor Kelsey has again shown ⁴

how admirably he can meet the wants of good teachers. But his edition
ol Ovid does more than this. lt must quicken the poetic sense of even
the most prosaic teachers. l cannot help feeling that many a pupil will
thank Professor Kelsey for having shown how the same themes that in·
spired Ovid still live in our own English classics. We have had given to
us a manual of mythology, a scholarly edition of a Latin classic, and an
abundance of poetic inspiration‚ all at once Ovid did not write to ex-
hibit the grammatical usages of his day, or to help make philologists3 and
Professor Kelsey has not made the mistake of supposing that his verses
are best used when they are made to serve such purposes.

Ptofessor George fl. white, Oberlin College: The notes are made attrac·
tive‚ and their meaning more clear, by many quotations from a wide range
of English poets. ln this latter respect it is superior to every other school
edition of the ancient classics. Ι commend the book without reserve.
