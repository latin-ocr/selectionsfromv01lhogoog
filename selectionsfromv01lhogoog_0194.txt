VII. SERVIUS TULLIUS.

became king of the Romans after Tarquinius. 2. On ac·
count of awondersul prodigy which happened, Tarquinius
was² persuaded to bring up Servius at his house as if ⁸ he
were his own child. 3. Let us seize the standard and send
it against the enemy. 4. If the Romans fight⁹ bravely in
order to recover the standard, they will carry off the victory.
5. When the shepherds had killed Tarquinius, Tanaquil con·

spirited daughter of Servius to the violent son of Tarquin-
ius, lest they kill the king. 10. If the son of Tarquinius
had not been urged on¹² by Tullia, he would not have recov-
