made dictator. He changed the plan oi campaign,3 sor he ,

did not join battle with Hannibal, but tried to wear out⁴ the
Carthaginian³ by delay. Once he nearly destroyed Hanni-
bal’s⁶ whole army, which he had shut in a narrow pass,

Minucius, the master of horse, to whom Fabius's delay
was not agreeable‚ accused him οἱ6 prolonging the war, and
