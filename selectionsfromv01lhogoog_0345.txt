HE first distinctive feature of this book is, as its name sug-
gests, that the lessons contain connected Latin passages
for the pupi} to read. As soon as practicable, the special gram·
matioel points to be learned in each lesson are illustrated‚ not in
disconnected sentences, but in a continuous Latin story. The
stories are drawn chiefly from Roman mythology and traditional
¹Roman history, interspersed with an occasional passage on the
life ol the Romans. This plan has the advantages of acting as
a powerful incentive to work5 of adding directly to the pupil's
knowledge ot Roman mythology, traditions‚ and customs; and
of emphasizing at the outset the fact that grammaris merelya
means to the enjoyment of literature.

The second feature is that the exercises sor translating English
into Latin are based on the text immediately preceding thern.

A third point of special importance is that, beginning with
Lesson ΧΧ., apassage to be translated at sight is included in
every lesson ln the report of the Latin Conference to the Com·
mittee on Secondary School studies, this point is particularly
emphasized. Questions for the pupil are inserted at the end of
each lesson. These are not intended to take the place of ques-
tions by the teacher, but are merely to enable the pupil to ascer-
tain whether he has thoroughly mastered his lesson. All the.
necessary principles ol English Grammar are incorporated in
the body os the book.

Lastly‚ questions in ,Latin referring to the text are included,
in the belief that nothing sits the pupil more quickly to under·
stand Latin without translating‚ than this method of asking and
answering questions in latin. It is expected that the use ol
this book will not only add to the beginner's enjoyment of
Latin, but that it will insure rapid progress and unusual tacility

1‘n reading and understanding the language. Ι
