them. But he fled to the Volscians, by whom his valor was
highly esteemed ; lor they made him their leader. Then
Coriolanus led the Volscians against Rome, and would have

XI. PYRRHUS.

Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, who claimed-t0·be-deseended³
from Achilles, was summoned⁴ into Italy by the people-
os-Tarentum‚ on whom the ,Romans had declared⁶ war.
Although he defeated the Romans in the first battle, yet he
lost the flower⁶ oi his army, and said to his friends aster the
battle that if he should gain⁷ another such battle he would-
have-to-retum⁸ to Epirus alone. With Pyrrhus came Cineas,
a man ol great¹ eloquente, who tried to persuade the Romans
to make peace, but they replied that they would not make
peace until Pyrrhus departed⁷ from Italy. .

Appius Claudius, though he was blind and old, had great
influence with⁹ the Romans. For when Cineas wished to
persuade them to make peace, and the senate seemed to
incline towards making a treaty, Appius was carried ¹⁰ into
the senate house ¹¹ and persuaded 1⁰ them to reply to Pyrrhus
that he' must⁸ leave Italy is he wished⁷ to have peace with
the Romans.
