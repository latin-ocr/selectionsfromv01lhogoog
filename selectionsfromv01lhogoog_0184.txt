proper name to avoid ambiguity‚ or use such paraphrases
as ‘the king‚' ‘the Carthaginien,' etc, a carelully chosen

VII. Be careful in the use of pronouns. On s? and suus
see B. 2445 A. 196 ; H. 448 and 449. In your Latin read-
ing carefully observe the use of pronouns.

VIII. Purpose may be expressed in various ways, hut not
(in prose) by the infinitive.

IX. The voluntary agent is expressed hythe ablative
wt'th a preposition3 the means or instrument, by the abla-
tive withouta preposition.

X. Be careful in translating English prepositions: eg.
‘He killed him with a sword‚’ gladio eum interficit,- ‘he
went with him,' cum eb inin· ‘when he heard os this,’ cum
d? hoc audivisset: ‘a man of great eloquence‚’ wir magnei
eloquenti& ,· ‘the shepherd os the king‚’ postor regius. Deter-

’ mine the exact force os the English preposition‚ and translate
accordingly.

XI. In translating into Latin such sentences as ‘the man
I saw,' the relative cannot be omitted. In cases where in
English two nouns are connected by a preposition‚ unless
the relation can he expressed in Latin hythe genitive, a
relative clause is generally necessary: eg. ‘The embassy
from PyrrhuS,’ either [Μή ligatio or ligdtto quae ᾶ Pyrrhe
missa est (or erat). Frequently an adjective may be used:
eg. ‘In the war with Jugurtha,' belm Iugurthino (see p. 54,
l. 5, and the cross references).

XII. A personal or demonstrative pronoun at the begin-
ning of a sentence, and sometimes a noun (see Vl), is often
best translated into Latin hya relative pronoun. ⁸
