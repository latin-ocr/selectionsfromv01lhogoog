2. Curibus, ex oppido: ‘from Cures, a town of the Sabines'·
B. 229, 2; A. 258, a, cf. 184,c; H. 412, 11. ³. Qui oum:
‘When he.‘ Note that the subject of a subordinate clause very
often precedes the conjunction which introduces the clause.
4. religione: Β. 2183 A. 248, c, 13 H. 420. Vestae: cl.
Romulo, p. 4, l. 25. 5. alendum: see n. to p. 1, l. 15· ἵ
virginibus: although the institution ol the Vestal virginsis
ascribed to Numa, it will be remembered that Romulus was the
son of a Vestal. Livy explains the discrepancy by saying that
the institution had existed at Alba. It undoubtedly goes back
to very early times. ⁸

6. flaminem . . . creavit: ‘he appointed a priest (to be)
flamen ol Jupiter' The flamen was a priest devoted to a particu-
lar deity. For the constr, see p. 1, l. 4. instent veste: the

censors, and flamens; also to the dictator and the magawer

ings of the word.

10. quibus sacris fulmina essent procuranda: the falling
of a thunderbolt was regarded by the Romans as a portent, and
the direful omen was averted by propitiatory offerings. Accord-
ing to the legend, Jupiter intended that human sacrifices should
be offered on such occasions, but Numa cleverly outwitted him

· and substituted others. 12. daturum . . . esse: B. 331, 13

A. 330, f. 14. futurum esset: see n. to p. 2,1. 16. 15. an·
