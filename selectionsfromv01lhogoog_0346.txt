RADATIM offers an excellent selectiou os easy reading-
matter which may be used to arouse and stimulate the
interest of the pupil in his early study of Latin. It may be used
either ior lessons to be regularly prepared by classes just begin·
ning the subject, or for sight-reading by more advanced stu-
dents. The abundanceof material offered will allow the teacher
to select such stories as will best serve his particular purpose.
The special excellence of Gradatim lies in the intrinsic interest
of the stories. ln this respect it is equalled by no similar book
that has been ever issued.

Twenty-five pages of Latin stories, which illustrate the use oi
the Accusative with the Infinitive, the Subjunctive ol lndirect
· Question, and the Ablative Absolute, have been added to the
original work. This is the only edition of the work in which
these three subjects are especially treated.

In the first third of the book, all long vowels have been
marked3 elsewhere they are marked only in words which are
likely to be mispronounced, or which occur for the first time.

The Vocabulary has been entirely rewritten, aud its scope
much enlarged.

'Ray Greene Huling, Principal of the English Higlr Schoel, Cambridge,
Mass: ln its original English form it was a delightlul primer, and has
relieved the drudgery oi elementary work in Latin in many schools. The
changes introduced by this editor are genuine additions, making the work
a much better supplementary book ior early translation than before.

fl. S. (lowen, CuskIng Ac'ademy‚ Asmurnam, Mass. : Ι regard it as a
very valuable book ior supplementary work lor first-year Latin students.

Professor John Η. (hove, Oln'o Wesleyan University: It is certainly an
admirable book to put into the hands oi beginners in Latin as a com·
panion to the Latin Grammar. In both matter and general appearance
the work will commend itself to instructors.

B. 1¹· D’Ooge‚ Narmal School, l'psilanti‚ Mol„- It is in my judgment by far
· the best collection oi easy Latin Selections avallable.
