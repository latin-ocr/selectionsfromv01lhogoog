Phoe 28] Fabius Maximus 127

Romans ever experienced. Livy relates a story to the effect that
the iury of the combatants was such that they were unconscious
of a destructive earthquake shock which occurred during the
battle. See Byron, Cluilde Harold, 1v‚ 73:

“And such the shock of battle on this day,
And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds
To allsave carnage, that, beneath the fray,
An earthquake rolled unheedingly away.”

25. diotetor: an extraordinary magistrate appointed in time
of peril. lle held his office sor six months only, and was
preceded by twenty-tour lictors with the fasces and axes. lle
had associated with him a lieutenant called the Master of
Horse (magister equitum), whom he usually appointed himself.
As he had no colleague, and was irresponsible, his power was
greater than that of the consul. impetum mori tregit: i.e.
he checked Hannibal's victorious career by a policy of delay.
His design was to harass Hannibal and tire him out, without
risking a decisive battle. From the successful outcome of these
tactics ‘Fabian policy' has become proverbial.
