once for all the meanings of new words. They may be greatly
helped in the latter regard by having their attention called to the

derivation of new words, and to the force and meaning of suffixes
and prefixes. The force of particles should also be carefully

3. Latin Writing and Latin composition. The ability
to write idiomatic Latin, and to express oneself orally in Latin,
is of the highest valne3 not for its own sake, but because in no
¹ other way can a knowledge of forms and constructions, and a
feeling for the idioms of the language, be so easily acquired.
Constant practice of this kind in the earlier years of a pupil's
course gives an accuracy of expression which can be acquired
only with great difficulty later.

A number of sentences and passages based on the text will
be found on pp. 143 fol. The pupil should begin as soon as
possible to translate continuous passages into Latin, and to
write short compositions in Latin on such subjects as Romulus,
Marius, Caesar, etc.

The translation of detached sentences, while of little value as
a means of learning to write latin, may be made a valuable
preparation for writing Latin, and a generally helpful exercise,
provided the work be done orully and very rapidly. For sug-
gestions about this kind ol work, see the Prefatory Note to the
Exnncrsns ron Tnnnsnnrrorv nvro Lnrrrv.

Sentences of this kind may be supplemented by turning direct
discourse into indirect, and vz'ce versa,- an exercise which is
frequently suggested in the NOTE53 or by asking questions in
Latin on the subject-matter of the lessons in translation, the
replies being, of course, rn Latin. The latter exercise is strongly
recommended, since it also gives the pupil practice in transla-
tion at hearing.
