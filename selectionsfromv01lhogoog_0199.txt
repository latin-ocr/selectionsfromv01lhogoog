Pyrrhus seems to have been of a merciful dispositi0n¹;
for although the people of Tarentum said that they had
spoken disrespectsully2' of ³ the king when they were heated
with³ wine, he did not condemn them, because he thought
it was the fault of the wine rather than of the men.

XII. FABRICIUS.

Gaius Fabricius was a good man and distinguished inwar,
but very poor. lt is said that Pyrrhus could neither bribe
“ him with gold nor terrify him,- aud that although the king
seeretly offered him the fourth part of his kingdom, if he
would consent⁴ to live with him, Fabricius⁵ could not be
persuaded to desert the Roman cause. But on the other
hand Pyrrhus's physician could not induce Fabricius to
promise him a reward in case he should kill6 the king.⁷

When Fabricius heard that there wasa man⁸ at Athens
who said that everything which was done ought to be referred
to pleasure, he is said to have wished that his enemies‘⁵ might
be persuaded of that, in order that they might be the more
easily conquered.

Although Fabricius despised⁰ money himself and could
not be turned from (the path of) integrity ¹⁰ by the offer¹¹ oi
gold, yet when a dangerous war was-imminent,1² he advo-
cated13 the election of Rufinus an avaricious man, as con-
sul, because (as he said) ¹⁴ he preferred to be robbed rather
than to be sold. ’
