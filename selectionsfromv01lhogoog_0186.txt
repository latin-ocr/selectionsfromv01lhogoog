Translation* into Latin ¹ 151

or licet lac factum ,· ‘I can do this,' hic fucere possum,· ‘I ,
ought to do this,’ kbcfacere a'ebcb, or oportet m? hbcfuccras

‘ Ι must do this,’ m? horsacm neccsse est, necesse cst ut hoc
factum, or hoc mihi faciendum. In the past tenses the
auxiltiuy becomes past, and not the infinitive asin English:
eg. licuit mihi hocfaccrc.

XXI. Some verbs are used with either the infinitive or
the subjunctive with a difference oi meaning3 the former
if the idea is really indirect discourse, the latter if it is
purpose: eg. ‘He persuades me that this is so,' mihi pcr-
suridct Ιιῦε ita esse,· ‘he persuades me to do this,' milri
persuadet ut hocsaciam.

XXII. To write good Latin one must not only express
himself with grammatical correctness, but also idiomatically.
Many English expressions cannot be rendered literally; in
iacta continuous passage oi idiomatic English can hardly
ever be translated word for word into idiomatic Latin. Read
the passage carefully, and translate the thought, not the
words
