Α Latin Grammar

By Professor Cuhn‘uus E. anwnrn, Cornell University. 12mo, cloth,
263 pages. Price, 80 cents.

N this book the essential facts of Latin Grammar are pre-
sented within the smallest compass consistent with high
scholarly standards. lt covers not only the work of the pre-
paratory school, but also that of the required courses in college ἶ
and university. By omitting rare forms and syntactical usages
found only in ante-classical and port-classical Latin, and by
relegatiug to an Appendix theoretical and historical questions,
it hasbeen found possible to treat the subject with entire ade-
quacy in the compass of 250 pages exclusive of Indexes. ln
the German schools‚ books of this scope fully meet the exacting
demands of the entire gymnasial course, and those who have
tried Bennett's Grammar find that they are materially helped by
being relieved of the massot useless and irrelevant matter which
forms the bulk of the older grammars.

Professor william A. Houghton, Bowdoin Collega, Brunswick, Maine:
The Grammar proper is admirably adapted to its purpose in its clearness
of arrangement and classification, and in its simplicity and precision of
statement, giving definitely just what the pupil must know, and not crowd·
ing the page with a mass of matter that too often disheartens the young
student instead of helping him. 1 trust it will come into general use, for
l think for tlte reasons just given, and because of its moderate compass >
and attractive appearance, students are likely to get more practical gram·
matical knowledge out of it than they generally do from the larger
grammars. ·

Professor Atfred M. Wllson‚ University of Nebraska, Lincoln: Ihave ,
examined it very carefully, and l can say, truly and with pleasure, that
my srrst impressions bave become positive convictions asto the very great
value and utility of the book. l am daily using it with increasing dolight
and satisfaction. lt is clear, concise, and mdependent.

The critic, Feb. 29, 1896. The book is a marvel of condensed, yet clear
and forcible, statement. Just enough examples are given to illustrate each
principle without discouraging the pupil by their number and variety.
'l'he ground covered in the treatment of forms and syntax is adequate

tor ordinary school work and for the use of freshmen and sophomores itt
college.
