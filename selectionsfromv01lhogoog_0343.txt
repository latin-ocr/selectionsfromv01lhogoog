twenty full-page Illustrations, by Professor Fahwcrs W. Kucsuv, Uni·
versity oi Michigan. 12mo‚halt leather, 506 pages. Price, ἕως.

HROUGHOUT the book every effort has been made, by
way of illustration and comment, to render the study ol
Caesar attractive and useful, a means of culture as well as of dis·
cipline, That the result has been to produce the best-equipped
edition of the Gallie War is generally conceded.

The Introduction, besides giving a lull review of Caesar's life
aud character, lurnishes also a concise and logical account ol
the Roman art of war in Caesar's time. The Illustrations con·
sist of six full-page colored plates‚ ot a double-page map ol Gaul,
and of iourteen full-page maps and plans.

The text is clear, accurate, and uniformia its orthography‚
and is conveniently dlvided by brief English summaries. ,
The Notes are apt and sensible, with full references to the

Grammars of Bennett, Allen and Greenough, and Harkness.

The Table of ldioms and Phrases‚ found in no other edition,
will enable a teacher to drill his class on those constructions
whi'ch are most perplexing to beginners.

The Vocabulary‚ like the Notes, is intended to give the pupil
ouly such help as he needs, and such knowledge as he can digest.

charles S. Chapin, Prr'ncipal Higlv Schoel, Fitclrburg, Mose: I consider
Kelsey’s Caesar, both for teacher and pupil, the most admirable edition iu
the field, combInIng ln one volume text, notes, dIctionary oi antiquities,
maps, and all the instruments lor successful study ol the Commentaries.

0. D. Robinson, Principal Higlz Schoel, Albam, NJ: As =a text-book it
seems to meis not absolutely perfect, to approach as near perlection as
any book I have ever examIned. The Introduction and colored plates
are invaluable as aids to a clear understanding oi the text, and are su·
perior to anything ol the hlud elsewhere. The maps, notes, vocabulary,
und table oi idIoms, are unsurpassed in any text-book oi Caesar now ln use.

Richard M. Jones, Head Master‚ Wm. Penn Charter Scbool, Philadel-
phia : Kelsey's Caesar is, in my judgment‚ the nearest approach yet made
in this country to what a school editIon ol an ancient clasSIc should be.
